Amazon market analysis with market-basket model

This project aims to create a Market-Basket-Model-based food recommender using Fine Food Reviews offered by Kaggle. Market Basket Model is the expression of data sets adopting the concepts of Market, Basket, and Item. A relationship discovered from each set of items can be applied to relationships found from other ones. In the case of data from Kaggle, most of the users had written only one review and most of the products have only one review, which means there are a small number of meaningful baskets. This means the number of recommendations would be small. So it is expected to have low recall. Most reviews are positively biased so it seems that once recommending food, the value of precision would be high. Among 568454 reviews, outliers having too small or too big baskets are excluded and others are distributed into training data and test data with a probability of 0.90. 0.97 of test data compose baskets and others are judged whether they would be recommended. The Market-Basket-Model-based test using the processed data sets made a result of precision of 0.976 and recall of 0.621. It supports the previous assumption that a recall is influenced by the average size of baskets and a precision is affected by a data bias. This will help select data to be used and improve the efficiency and accuracy of a recommendation system.
